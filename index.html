                    <p>I started tutoring 6 years ago, at the age of 14. What started out as helping my classmates with math, chemistry and physics soon turned into my lifelong passion project.</p>
                    <p>I am currently a student at Purdue University, studying Computer Science and Mathematics. I truly believe that every learner is special, and have made it my mission to help every learner that comes my way see how wonderful they are.</p>
